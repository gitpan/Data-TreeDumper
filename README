Fixed:
- Should run under Windows (please let me know if it doesn't)
- Added NO_OUTPUT (see documentation for iterator example)

Ex:

my $tree = { ... } ;
print DumpTree($tree, 'Tree:') ;

#output

Tree:

|  |- bbbbbb = CODE(0x8139fa0) [C3]
|  |- c123 [C4 -> C3]
|  `- d [R5]
|     `- REF(0x8139fb8) [C6 -> C3]
|- ARRAY [A7]
|  |- 0 [S8] = elment_1
|  |- 1 [S9] = element_2
|  `- 2 [S10] = element_3
`- C [H11]
   `- b [H12]
      `- a [H13]
         |- a [H14]
